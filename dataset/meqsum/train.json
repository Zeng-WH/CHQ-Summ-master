Retina fallen down , lens damaged . I had n't been operated at that point only later , in 2003 when the pressure was very high ( above 30 mp ) . This first operation had fixed the retina with endolaser , removed vitreous body filled with silicone oil , replaced the lens with an artificial one and stabilized the pressure to around 15-10 mp . However , the eye got blood , retina got detached and it had to be operated again . This time , the oil replaced with gas . After 2 years , another attempt made with oil and lastly with gas , but the retina fallen again and again . Currently , the retina is still detached , the pressure is low ( max 4 mp ) , has often blood around the iris and it hurts a bit when the air pressure changes . I can not see anything with it apart from blur lights . The doctor says , this damaged eye is shrinking continuously . My other eye functioning well . I learned to live together with it , however , the doctor says , he strongly recommends enucleation . I dont know if there is any other option to avoid enucleation . I have 2 young children so if there were any option to avoid enucleatio , I would happy travel/pay for that . Kindly let me know if there is any other option . My main priority -if available- would be to live with my own or another organic eye which does n't look scary even if it is not functional .

She is unable to digest any formula milk or any milk products . When she was a new born , I started giving her Lactogen ( a formula milk ) a little bit along with my milk . She was fine with it but after 3 weeks , I switched her to another formula milk named Nan Pro 0 which is for babies upto 1 year . She started drinking that along with my breast milk . After 2 weeks , she started getting Diarrhea and a severe one where she pooped at least 15 times in one day . Therefore , I consulted the doctor and the doctor immediately asked me to put her on breast milk only . I did try that but she was hungry and crying therefore , I gave her a little bit of formula milk aswell . She was file with all the medicines . However , once the medicine stooped , she again started getting diarrhea . This continued on and off . After a while , the doctor asked me to stop the formula milk and start giving her Zerolac ( soy milk ) along with breast feeding . I did that and everything smoothened . However , after 2 months , I asked my doctor if we can start giving her any type of milk apart from zerolac as I was concerned about her getting calcium in her body with having milk . The doctor asked me to give her formula milk ( Nan Pro 0 ) . I did that but just after half an hour , she suddenly started vomiting which continued till she had the milk in her stomach . Once that stopped , she started getting diarrhea which continued till 3 days . She was put back on Zerolac again and breast milk . As she is now 6 months old , I thought of giving Cerelac to her but again she did not digest it and went through the same problem again . I am unable to find the right doctor here in India where I live . Please help my daughter in this situation .
